Read on for useful tips for new cat parents, and for those looking to brush up<br>

<br><br><b>Feeding<br><br></b>
We recommend purchasing high-quality, brand-name kitten or cat food.<br> 
Your veterinarian will be able to assess your new cat or kitten and determine<br>
the best diet. Factors such as age, activity level and health make a difference<br> 
in what and how much a cat should eat.<br>
<ul>
<li>Cats require taurine, an essential amino acid, for heart and eye health.<br> 
The food you choose should be balanced for the life stage of your cat<br> 
or kitten. Properly balanced foods will contain taurine.<br><br></li>
<li>You will need to provide fresh, clean water at all times, and wash and refill<br> 
your cat’s water bowls daily.<br><br></li>
<li>Treats should be no more than 5-10% of the diet.<br><br></li>
<li>Many people feed baby food to a cat or kitten who is refusing food or not<br> 
feeling well  Please read labels carefully: If the baby food contains onion<br> 
or garlic powder, your pet could be poisoned.<br><br></li>
<li>Take your pet to your veterinarian if signs of anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting<br> 
or lethargy continue for more than two days.<br><br></li></ul>

<br><br><b>Grooming<br><br></b>
Most cats stay relatively clean and rarely need a bath, but you should brush or<br> 
comb your cat regularly. Frequent brushing helps keep your cat's coat clean,<br> 
reduces the amount of shedding and cuts down on the incidence of hairballs.<br> <br>

<b>Handling<br><br></b>
To pick up your cat, place one hand behind the front legs and another under<br> 
the hindquarters. Lift gently. Never pick up a cat by the scruff of the neck or<br> by the front legs.<br><br>

<b>Housing<br><br></b>
Your pet should have her own clean, dry place in your home to sleep and rest.<br> 
Line your cat's bed with a soft, warm blanket or towel. Be sure to wash the<br> 
bedding often. Please keep your cat indoors. Outdoor cats do not live as long<br> 
as indoor cats. Outdoor cats are at risk of trauma from cars, or from fights<br> 
with other cats, raccoons and free-roaming dogs. Coyotes are known to eat<br> 
cats. Outdoor cats are more likely to become infested with fleas or ticks, as<br> well as contract infectious diseases.<br><br>

<b>Identification<br><br></b>
If allowed outdoors, your cat must wear a safety collar and an ID tag. A safety<br> 
collar with an elastic panel will allow your cat to break loose if the collar gets<br> 
caught on something. And for both indoor and outdoor cats, an ID tag or an<br> 
implanted microchip can help ensure that your cat is returned if he or she<br> becomes lost.<br><br>

<b>Litter Box<br><br></b>
All indoor cats need a litter box, which should be placed in a quiet, accessible<br> 
location. In a multi-level home, one box per floor is recommended. Avoid<br> 
moving the box unless absolutely necessary, but if you must do so, move the<br> 
box just a few inches per day. Keep in mind that cats won't use a messy,<br> 
smelly litter box, so scoop solid wastes out of the box at least once a day.<br> 
Dump everything, wash with a mild detergent and refill at least once a week;<br> 
you can do this less frequently if using clumping litter. Don't use ammonia,<br> 
deodorants or scents, especially lemon, when cleaning the litter box. If your<br> 
cat will not use a litterbox, please consult with your veterinarian. Sometimes<br> 
refusal to use a litter box is based on a medical condition that required treatment.<br><br>

<br><br><b>Scratching<br><br></b>
Cats need to scratch! When a cat scratches, the old outer nail sheath is pulled<br> 
off and the sharp, smooth claws underneath are exposed. Cutting your cat’s<br> 
nails every two to three weeks will keep them relatively blunt and less likely to<br> 
harm the arms of both humans and furniture. Provide your cat with a sturdy<br> 
scratching post, at least three feet high. The post should also be stable<br> 
enough that it won't wobble during use, and should be covered with rough<br> 
material such as sisal, burlap or tree bark. Many cats also like scratching pads.<br><br>

<b>Health<br><br></b>
Your cat should see the veterinarian at least once a year for an examination<br> 
and annual shots, and immediately if she is sick or injured.<br><br>

<b>Medicines and Poisons<br><br></b>
Never give your cat medication that has not been prescribed by a<br> 
veterinarian. If you suspect that your animal has ingested a poisonous<br> 
substance, call your veterinarian. or the ASPCA Animal Poison Control Center<br> for 24-hour animal poison information at (888) 426-4435.<br><br>

<b>Spaying and Neutering<br><br></b>
Female cats should be spayed and male cats neutered by five months of age.<br><br>

<b>Vaccinations<br><br></b>
Your veterinarian will make recommendations based on your cat's age and health.<br><br>
